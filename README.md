⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a website name and URL into the input fields.
2. JavaScript validates the input:
   - The name field must not be empty.
   - The URL must follow a valid format (e.g. `https://example.com`)
3. On submission:
   - The bookmark is saved to `localStorage`
   - A new bookmark card is displayed in the UI
4. Each bookmark has a delete button to remove it from both the UI and storage.
